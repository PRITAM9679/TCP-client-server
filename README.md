<h3> Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder containing the scripts.</h3>
<img height = 100 width=900 src = "https://github.com/PRITAM9679/Python-programming/blob/main/index1.png">
<br>
The terminal will appear to hang as we there is no connections active now only the server is running<br><br>
 Now, run the echo-client script in another terminal,
 <img height=100 width = 900 src="https://github.com/PRITAM9679/Python-programming/blob/main/index.png">
 Now in the echo-server window, 
 <img height=100 width = 900 src="https://github.com/PRITAM9679/Python-programming/blob/main/index2.png">
 
<br><br>
So these will be the outputs of the files.
If you are doing in linux insted of './' use <br>
  python server.py<br>
  python client.py
